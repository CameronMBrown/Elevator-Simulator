# Elevator-Simulator

PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS:
    You've been hired by a construction firm to help build the "brain" for a set of elevators in a new building.
    The building has 10 floors, a lobby and a basement, call the floors -1...10
    The building has 2 elevators:
      Elevator A can go to all floors EXCEPT the penthouse (floor 10)
      Elevator B can go to all floors EXCEPT the basement (floor -1)

NOTES:
    - Promises used to create semaphores that control order of certain events.
    - Text files are included with this script to generate random passenger names for each passenger.
    - After a successful run, this script should create a log file corrisponding to each individual
    elevator shaft. These logs will be easier to read and understand than the standard console output.
    - There is no GUI component to this app
